          <p>Harvey Reginald Specter, Esq. is an attorney and a name partner, as well as one of the two managing partners, of Pearson Specter Litt. After being promoted to the position of senior partner at Pearson Hardman, he hired Mike Ross, a veritable genius who was able to pass the bar exam despite not attending law school, as his associate.</p>
       </div>
       <h2>MIKE</h2>
       
        <div class="mike-intro">
          <img src="parallax/mike.png" alt="mike" class="mike-intro-img">
          <p>Michael "Mike" James Ross is a lawyer and junior partner at Pearson Specter Litt, a legal consultant/supervisor at the Eastside Legal Clinic, and a former investment banker at Sidwell Investment Group. He is engaged to Rachel Zane.
<br>
He was hired by Harvey Specter, a senior partner at Pearson Hardman, as an associate lawyer, despite Mike not having graduated college or having a law degree. Mike left Pearson Specter after accepting the job offer to work at SIG; however, he returns later in season 4 after Jonathan Sidwell fired him from his firm.</p>

       <h2>LOUIS</h2>

          <img src="parallax/louis.png" alt="louis" class="louis-intro-img">
          <p>Louis Marlowe Litt, Esq. is a lawyer and name partner as well as one of the two managing partners at Pearson Specter Litt. He was promoted to the position of senior partner at Pearson Hardman by Daniel Hardman prior to the latter's dismissal from the firm, and retained his position after the subsequent merger with Darby International. Louis was in a relationship with Sheila Sazs and they were due to be engaged; however their relationship ended due to a disagreement of having kids or not. 
          <br>Louis initially resigned from Pearson Specter to prevent Jessica or Harvey from firing him after he embezzled money for Charles Forstman, but after discovering that Mike Ross was a fraud and that the others covered it up, he attempted to use that information to blackmail Jessica into making him a name partner at Pearson Specter, thus forming Pearson Specter Litt.</p>

        <h2>RACHEL</h2>
        <div class="rachel-intro">
          <img src="./parallax/rachel.png" alt="rachel" class="rachel-intro-img">
          <p>Rachel Elizabeth Zane, B.A. is a paralegal and part-time associate at Pearson Specter Litt who is currently engaged to Mike Ross. She is a Juris Doctor candidate at Columbia Law School.<br>
          Rachel worked as a paralegal for five years before finally achieving an LSAT score high enough for Columbia Law School.<br>
    Rachel is viewed as the eye candy of the associates. She is a respected member of the firm and one of the best when it comes to what she does prompting the help of her other co-workers.

        <h2>DONNA</h2>
        
        <div class="donna-intro">
          <img src="https://github.com/khk98/Parallax/blob/master/images/cast/donna.png" alt="donna" class="donna-intro-img">
          <p>Donna Roberta Paulsen is an executive assistant at Pearson Specter Litt, currently working for Harvey Specter. Having worked for him for 12 years, she briefly left him to work for Louis Litt; however, Louis fired her so that she could go back to work for Harvey.
          <br>
          Donna is one of the most formidable minds at Pearson Specter Litt. Extremely perceptive, armed with the knowledge of all the comings and goings at the firm and a razor sharp wit, Donna is admired and feared by both associates and partners alike, and she's not afraid to wield that power when it suits her needs.
<br>
Having been with Harvey since his days in the D.A.'s office, Donna keeps the fine machinery of his life well oiled and is privy to all his secrets - including the truth about Mike. But even though she likes to keep the young associate on his toes, Donna is a trusted ally who Mike can turn to when the going truly gets rough. And at a firm like Pearson Specter Litt, that happens a lot.
